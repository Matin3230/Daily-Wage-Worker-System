# Daily-Wage-Worker-System


  The project “Daily wage worker management system” aims to keep daily based records of wage workers working in various departments. This system maintains the information about number of workers entering and exiting the plant and the particular department and their entry and exit time collected from the security and supervisors. The reports generated from the data stored by security and supervisors will be available to the plant head, so the frauds/cheats at the supervisors/manager level can be detected easily.
